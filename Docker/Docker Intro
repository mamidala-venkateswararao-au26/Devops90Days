Docker :

ENV: env is nothing but collection of certen things. Which are rtequire to day to day operations.

certen things --> ram,os,HD,IDE,java base application,python base applications

Libraries : Libraries are nothuing but files which are need to run to applications. or supporting files for your applications.


I want to develop one applaction:

Dev will work on application (ex: cal) .
|
|
once dev is done next process is Build process --> to cobaining differnt feature to one applaction. it appeare .exe file like this.

Testing team will come --> check wheather all the feathers are working fine are not..

Pre Proud
UAT
RFS --> ready for service

There is problem with ENV ..   -> Application is running in Dev but not working in Testing team .. there is problem with EnV
second problem is Multipule copies same application is not possible.

In Such a case CONTAINERS comes to the pictures.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Containers:
It is used for storage purpose,. it won't mix.. Isolated area.

container is nothing but vartual box . we can create deployable product. it conataine App plus ENv and i won't mix with another app. and isolated are 
this means this is not mix with others. and same time we create multipule copies of applications.





Containers :  -> Copy1    copy2   copy3        --> step4
              -> Applications(Ansible,Python)  --> step3
              ->Operating System(Linux)       --> step2
              -> Vartuval Michine (EC2)        -> step1

Docker : Docker is containarazion tool which is used to create the containers.
