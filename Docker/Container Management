This is 2nd class..

Technical meaning of containers..  --> containers is nothing but process .. which is creat vartial box. 

Empty containers can be crated .. container is nothing but process.. process cannot be empty..

How to craete containers.?

Docker is tool to crate containers.. Contanizeration is tech.. docker is part of technology.. build ,test,deploy the aplication asolated are..
we can create mutlipule copies. 

DOCKER ARCTITURE OR COMPONENTES..


3 Things..

Docker Demon (Docker Engine) : Docker Demon is heart of Docker.. we can call it as a king of Empiror.
bakgroumd process.. which is responceble for all the process and all the operations....

Docker CLI : We cannot directly meet docker engine directly..there docker CLI (command line interface) helps to communicate
with docker engine..

Docker Images: in docker there are some images available.. take that images create empty container put the image into empty container..
Images is nothng but inside image app+ Env everything will be kept under the image.

Docker Registry: nothing but a place.. where all images are available.. Centralized repositary..


3 parts;

Container management :-> 
Image managemant

Docker Installation:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Install using the apt repository
Before you install Docker Engine for the first time on a new host machine, you need to set up the Docker apt repository. Afterward, you can install and update Docker from the repository.

Set up Docker's apt repository.


# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "${UBUNTU_CODENAME:-$VERSION_CODENAME}") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
Install the Docker packages.

Latest Specific version
To install the latest version, run:


 sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
Verify that the installation is successful by running the hello-world image:


 sudo docker run hello-world
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Docker info  --> if this command is working after the installations.. it means docker CLI communicate with docker demon..


Container creating 2 ways  --> Attached mode crateing
                           --> Detache mode creating

Commands of container managemant
---------------------------------

docker run --> use to creat the cotainer. it create empty container.

docker run <image> :
once the run above command fallowing deatiles wiil be create.
create container
uniqu id to container
start the container
attach the container or go inside the container.

--> docker run -it centos        --> if image is not in locally it pulls from central reposatory.

once the image is pull is complete it will allow you inside the container,..

exit is the command to come out of the conatiner..

docker run -it centos   --> if you run this command again it's alredy presnt in locally .. if not so they go docker registory. download the 
image and create the container..

and once you are in inside the containmer it will beisloted and it is pravite.


docker ps   _> all the only running conatiner .
docker ps -a -> all the running and hidden containers will show..


docker run -it --name devops centos        -> this will create centos image along with that devops name wwill be desplayed..(container name)

login container:
(docker start name/id) 
(docker attach name/id)

--> docker start devops
--> docker attach dvops

-it   --> interactive mode..
